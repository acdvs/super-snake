## Gameplay
What makes this variant of Snake unique is the many options you have to change the difficulty.

1. Playing field size - The playing field can be resized to a tiny box, a massive area covering your screen, and anything in between.
2. Boundaries - Tired of running into the edges? Turn them off and simply go into a wall and pop out of the opposite wall.
3. Obstacles - Sometimes getting around is too easy. Each time you pick up a block, a number of 1x1 obstacles will randomly spawn around you. Hit one and you lose.
4. Speed - Increase the speed to get from one end to the other much more quickly and test your reflexes, or decrease the speed and play a relaxing round of Super Snake.
